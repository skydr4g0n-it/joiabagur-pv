#: The corpus itself, versioned in git. That it lives in the repository is what makes a

#: Value written to `ai.knowledge_chunk.embedding_version`, alongside the model and the
#: dimension. **Never `SOURCE_TEXT_VERSION`**: that one versions the product text renderer.
#: Sharing it would mean a change to the product text marks the whole knowledge corpus
#: stale — waste, but visible — and, far worse, that a change to *these* chunking rules
#: would NOT invalidate anything, leaving vectors that declare themselves current while

SCHEMA_DOC_TYPES = frozenset({"material", "talla", "guion_venta", "politica", "faq"})

#: `guion_venta` is **excluded by design, not by scope**: an imperative fragment retrieved
#: into a prompt is indistinguishable from an instruction, which would make the corpus
#: itself an injection surface. See `design.md` D13.

#: Words that describe the scale of a motif. They are `size_label` terms too, and they are
#: **never** a ring fit label.
MOTIF_SCALE_WORDS = ("mini", "extramini", "pequeño", "mediano", "grande")

#: `circunferencia (mm) = talla española + 40`, the ordinary Spanish relation. Verifiable
#: outside the jewellery, which is why the section stating it is scoped `general` while the
#: section assigning letters to ranges is scoped `establecimiento`.
