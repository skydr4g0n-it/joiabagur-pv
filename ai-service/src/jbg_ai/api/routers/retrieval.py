# Substitutes over the STORED embedding: no provider is called on this path.
#
# `payload.pos_id` is ignored on purpose, like the products route: the scope comes from the
# token. The scope is read as a SIGNAL only — availability demotes a candidate and never
# removes it, and excluding on stock belongs to .NET, which owns the stock (C34).
#
# **The projection age travels in each result's `debug.notes`** and not in a response field.
# `RetrievalResponse` carries `projection_age_seconds`; `SubstitutesResponse` does not, and
# `ai-service/openapi.json` is frozen — adding the field would regenerate the snapshot that
# `test_openapi_snapshot_is_stable` guards. `debug` is in the frozen contract already, which
# makes it the one place the age can be declared without moving anything.
#
# No embedding settings are required here, only the database: the route that needs a
# provider is the one that embeds a query, and this one embeds nothing.
#
# **This is a comment and not a docstring, which is not a style choice.** FastAPI publishes a
# handler's docstring as the operation's `description`, and this operation has none in the
# frozen snapshot — it was written when the handler was a two-line stub. Writing the
# explanation here caught exactly that: the snapshot test went red on a `description` that
# appeared out of nowhere. The sibling handler above keeps its docstring because the snapshot
# already carries it.
