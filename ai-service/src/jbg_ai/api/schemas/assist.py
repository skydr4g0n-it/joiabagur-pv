"""Sale assistance contracts: family-grouped results, rule warnings and citations.

The `pitch` never contains a resolved price or stock figure — it carries the
`{{price}}` and `{{stock}}` placeholders for the .NET API to substitute. **And the
prohibition holds over the whole response, not only over the pitch**: no model here carries
a price, a stock quantity or the availability bucket the index keeps for ranking.

**This block moved once, in C30a, and the window was the reason.** The frozen shape could
not serve its consumer — `family_id` required against a catalogue where ~58 % of products
have no family, and `query` required against a consumer anchored to a piece — and at that
moment the route had **zero** consumers: `IAiGatewayClient` had no assist method and C34 did
not exist. Regenerating the snapshot is a contract negotiation and not a chore, as the
service README says; C18a and C18b set the precedent of doing it in the same change that
moves the boundary, and doing it later would have cost what doing it then did not.
