#: C21 fusion defaults, in one place so the field default, the blank-string fallback and

#: figure copied into a description is a snapshot that nothing re-measures, so it starts
#: lying the first time the corpus or the index moves. The reasoning is in

# --- C25bis retired four knobs from this block, and the reasons were not the same for all four.
#
# `JPV_FUSION_MODE` selected between the two-stage composition and C21's single fusion over
# every list. The second was kept selectable only so the published baseline row could be
# re-measured; once that table was published and frozen it became a dead path whose arithmetic
# the project had measured as defective, and a dead path that can be switched on by accident is
# how a corrected defect returns.
#
# `JPV_RRF_WEIGHT_TYPED` and `JPV_RRF_WEIGHT_EXPANDED` were NOT dead — they were the internal
# split of the lexical branch, on the live path. They went because the specification requires
# the two to be equal and forbids sweeping them, so a setting could only ever be moved into
# violation with nothing to detect it. A knob the rules forbid touching is worse than a dead
# one: it looks like a decision. They now live as `LEXICAL_INTERNAL_WEIGHT` in the orchestrator,
# and the move could not change a result because only stage one's ORDER reaches stage two.
#
# `JPV_RRF_WEIGHT_VECTOR` was the only one genuinely without a reader outside the retired path.
#
# A deployment that still exports any of the four has NO effect: they no longer exist, and the
# service composes the one way it can. Nothing is added to make the boot fail over them —
# what a run actually composed is recorded in the provenance of an evaluation run, which is
# where a reader can act on it, rather than inferred from the environment somebody intended.

#: C25 business-signal weights. Two weights, and they are NOT the same kind of number.
#:
#: `availability` is **calibrated**: it is swept against the golden set under the operational
#: metric of D3, with pure relevance as the guardrail. That sweep is possible because the
#: rubric's own scale supplies the hook — grade 1 is already defined as "a plausible
#: substitute the operator would offer second", and a piece that cannot be put on the cloth is
#: exactly that, so an exhausted grade 2 can be read as a grade 1 without inventing a constant.
#:
#: ONE weight, and it was two. The rotation term was **withdrawn, refuted by measurement**:
#: as the strict tiebreak its requirement described it decided 0 pairs in the top five across
#: all 48 queries, and as a component of the ordering key it was no tiebreak at all — it
#: inverted 11.067 pairs, 71,2 % of them more than ten positions apart, and cost relevance
#: where it acted. The figures are in the C25 implementation report.
#:
#: `availability` is read against the `computed_as_of` recorded on each projection row and
#: never against the wall clock: with a wall clock the figures go to zero, because the world
#: of C10 ends on 2026-08-23, and the ranking would be irreproducible by design.
BUSINESS_DEFAULTS: dict[str, Any] = {
    "jpv_business_weight_availability": 1.0,
}

#: C26 substitutes. ONE weight, and it is NOT the same kind of number as the availability
#: one above even though both ride in the same tail.
#:
#: `availability` there is binary against a key that was otherwise lexicographic, so its
#: value could not change the order — only its sign could, and the C25 sweep measured exactly
#: that. **That conclusion does not travel here.** In this ordering a binary size term is
#: mixed with a CONTINUOUS cosine similarity, so the weight fixes a real exchange rate — how
#: much similarity a wrong size is worth — and three values produce three different orders.
#: It is therefore swept, and the sweep is what fixes it; the figure of the last one is in
#: the C26 implementation report rather than here, where nothing would re-measure it.
#:
#: Zero is the rollback and reproduces exactly the ordering the remaining terms produce
#: alone. The term is inert whenever either side declares no size, because an absent size is
#: not a mismatch — 54 % of the rings carry none, so without that guard half the population
#: of the most affected piece type would be ordered by a mismatch that does not exist.

#: C25 abstention. The FORM was selected by a measurement under a criterion written before it
#: — the two populations of best-hit distance overlap completely, so a scalar bound cannot
#: separate them — and the relative rule reads the SHAPE of the distance profile instead: an
#: out-of-domain query is flat, because nothing in the catalogue stands out for it.
#:
#: **Fixed against the category once it grew to 20**, never against the five it had: two
#: parameters fitted to five points are fitted to five points, which is what this change
#: refused to do everywhere else. Measured over 20 out-of-domain and 43 answerable queries,
#: this point abstains on **2 of the 20 and on none of the 43** — the only operating points
#: that silence no answerable query are this one and two that catch less.
#:
#: The rate it buys is **10 %**, far from the 0,80 the ticket asked for, and the gap is
#: declared rather than closed: reaching 0,80 costs silencing **21 of the 43** answerable
#: queries, half the set. The asymmetry decides the point — silencing a query the shop CAN
#: answer is a visible failure at the counter, while failing to abstain on an impossible one
#: merely shows five pieces that do not fit and the operator can see that.
#:
#: It is on because the alternative signal does not do this job: `low_confidence` fires on 1
#: of the 20 out-of-domain queries and on 10 of the 43 answerable ones, which is
#: anti-correlated with what abstention needs.

#: C23 knowledge defaults, in one place for the same reason as FUSION_DEFAULTS: the field
#: default, the blank-string fallback and the canonical OpenAPI profile are three copies of
#: one value, and three copies drift. The threshold is the output of a calibration RULE and
#: not a preference; the rule, and the sweep that last applied it, are recorded in the C23
#: implementation report rather than here, where nothing would ever re-measure them.
#:
#: The threshold is the one the rule yields **against the production embedder on the live
#: index**, which is not the one the offline sweep yields: the stand-in scores lexical
#: overlap, so its distances live on another scale entirely and its optimum admits questions
#: the corpus does not cover. The offline sweep still calibrates the rule — it is what runs
#: without a provider — but the number has to come from the real index, and the tests keep
#: the two apart on purpose.
