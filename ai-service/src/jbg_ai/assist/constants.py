# --- C30b · the generation layer -----------------------------------------------------------

#: The prompt that writes the argument, and the value `prompt_version` reports. The path is
#: **derived** from it in `assist/prompt.py` and never named beside it, so a version that moved
#: while the file did not cannot stamp a response with a prompt that never reached the model —
#: the failure `enrichment/` already paid for once. `test_prompt_version_matches_the_loaded_
#: prompt_file` pins the other half.
#:
#: **Moved to v2 by C31, and `prompts/assist/v1.md` stays on disk untouched.** Adding the
#: free-query task sections to v1 would have silently changed what «v1» means for the 120
#: generations C30b measured against it, and those figures have to stay interpretable. The
#: invariant system rules are byte-identical between the two files; what v2 adds are task
#: sections — one per route the router can decide, plus the degraded one for an anchored
#: question the corpus does not cover. `test_the_previous_prompt_version_is_present_and_intact`
#: is what keeps v1 from being edited by accident later.
PROMPT_VERSION = "assist/v5"

#: The prompt of the **classifier**, versioned separately because it is a different call with a
#: different output and a different model setting. A router prompt that shared the argument's
#: version would make either figure unreadable the first time one of the two moved.
ROUTER_PROMPT_VERSION = "router/v3"

#: The model that writes the argument. A **module constant and not a setting**, for the reason
#: the timeout below is one: `JPV_RAG_LLM_MODEL` is C09's enrichment model — `gpt-4o` on this
#: deployment — and inheriting it would silently move the model of a counter-side call whose
#: cost, latency and measured rejection rate were all taken on this one. The credential is
#: shared (`JPV_RAG_LLM_API_KEY`, which exists since C09); the model is not.
DEFAULT_ASSIST_MODEL = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

#: Seconds **one provider call** may take — per call, never per request: a repaired request
#: makes two, and measuring its total against a one-call limit is how a five per cent cut reads
#: as seventy.
#:
#: Opened at three seconds as a product judgement with no latency measurement behind it. The
#: C30b sweep took one — 175 real calls, `evals/results/c30b-assist-sweep-5a6e1b4b8621.json` —
#: and it moved the value: **p50 2.216 s, p95 2.863 s**, with **8 of 175 calls (4,6 %) over
#: three seconds** and **1 of 175 (0,6 %) over four**. Three seconds sat at 1,05 × p95, which
#: is a cut that fires on jitter rather than on generations that are genuinely too slow.
#:
#: Raising it to four costs nothing for the ~95 % of calls that finish early — a timeout does
#: not slow a fast call down — and only changes the tail: at three seconds those requests are
#: served with no argument at all, at four they are served with one. The typical wait is
#: unchanged at ~2,2 s, which is what the "no sirve en un mostrador" argument is about.
#:
#: It is now **also adjustable**, which is what the design said to do if the sweep measured a
#: cut: `JPV_ASSIST_PITCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` supplies the default and the value travels by
#: parameter, so a deployment can set it against its own measured distribution rather than
#: against one taken on a developer machine in Spain through a TLS interceptor.
PITCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 4.0

#: Provider calls one request may make: the generation and, at most, **one** repair. The ceiling
#: is literal — there is no transient-retry loop underneath it — and that is a deliberate
#: departure from C09's seam, recorded in the implementation report: `ENRICH_BACKOFF_BASE_
#: SECONDS` is two seconds, so a single backoff sleep would consume two thirds of the budget
#: above before the retried call even started. Degrading is the cheaper answer at a counter.
MAX_PITCH_PROVIDER_CALLS = 2

# --- C31 · the intent router ---------------------------------------------------------------

#: The model that classifies the query. A **setting with its own variable**, and it never
#: inherits `JPV_ASSIST_LLM_MODEL` nor `JPV_RAG_LLM_MODEL` — the same measured argument C30b
#: used against inheriting C09's. These are calls of very different shape: ~30 output tokens
#: against a paragraph, so sharing a variable would make any cost comparison between them false.
#:
#: **Opened at `gpt-4o-mini` and moved to `gpt-4o` by the measurement, which is the whole reason
#: the variable is separate.** Over the 119 cases of `evals/routing/cases.yaml`, same prompt
#: (`router/v3`), temperature zero, full coverage on both arms:
#:
#:     modelo            catalog   falso positivo   silenciadas   veto
#:     gpt-4o-mini        81,3 %        6,25 %           3        NO PASA
#:     gpt-4o            100,0 %        0,00 %           0        PASA
#:
#: The veto of D12 is not a preference: a single silenced answerable query rejects the
#: configuration, and `gpt-4o-mini` silenced three — `el calzado tipico que se lleva en las
#: fiestas de la isla`, `una brujula para no perder el rumbo`, `una bicicleta antigua` — all
#: three of them queries that describe **the motif a piece depicts** rather than an article.
#: Three prompt revisions took that from fifteen to three and could not take it to zero; the
#: model took it to zero with no prompt change at all. **What decides this gate is the model.**
#:
#: The argument's model stays `gpt-4o-mini` and is untouched: that is what D9's separate
#: variable bought, and moving one without the other is the thing a shared variable would have
#: made impossible. Cost: ~700 input and ~30 output tokens per classification, so this arm is
#: of the order of 0,002 USD per request against the 0,00077 the argument measures — published
#: as its own figure in the C31 report and never folded into the argument's.
DEFAULT_ROUTER_MODEL = "openai/gpt-4o"

#: Seconds the **single** classifier call may take.
#:
#: **Declared NOT calibrated.** Two seconds is a product judgement with no latency measurement
#: behind it, in exactly the position C30b's three seconds occupied before its sweep moved the
#: value to four. The difference is that this cut is harder, because the classifier runs *in
#: front of everything*: a request that spends it has spent it before the retrieval starts.
#: It is also the reason `JPV_ROUTER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is deliberately left out of the deployment
#: steps until the deployment measures its own distribution — the default was taken on a
#: developer machine in Spain through a TLS interceptor and is an upper bound, not a budget.
#:
#: Exceeding it is a **fail-open**: the request proceeds unclassified, which is today's
#: behaviour, so the worst case of a badly chosen value is the behaviour this change replaces.
ROUTER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 2.0

#: Provider calls the classifier may make for one request. **One, and the one is literal**:
#: there is no retry and no repair underneath it. An unparseable label is a degradation and not
#: a violation to fix — there is nothing in a label to repair — and spending a second call on
#: it would buy a second opinion from the same model at temperature zero, which is the same
#: opinion. It also keeps C30b's measured decision not to retry on a parse failure intact.
MAX_ROUTER_PROVIDER_CALLS = 1

#: **The ceiling of the whole system, and it is literal: three.** One classifier call plus the
#: two of the argument. Derived from the two constants rather than written as a digit, so a
#: change to either cannot leave a stale three behind, and observable by introspection over the
#: accumulated `usage.calls` — the same property C30b delivered for two.
MAX_PROVIDER_CALLS = MAX_ROUTER_PROVIDER_CALLS + MAX_PITCH_PROVIDER_CALLS

#: here: there is no legitimate use of `€` in an argument whose price travels as a placeholder.

CAUSE_STOCK_ADJACENT = "stock_adjacent_figure"

#: apart is what says whether "continuous prose" is working.
CAUSE_ENUMERATION_FORMAT = "enumeration_format"
#: The two placeholders the generated argument carries instead of a price and a stock figure.
#: They live here, in the module that imports nothing, because both the contract schemas and the
#: integrity gate need them and the dependency only runs one way — towards this file. Declaring
#: them beside the schemas and reading them from the gate would put `api` inside `assist`.
PRICE_PLACEHOLDER = "{{price}}"
STOCK_PLACEHOLDER = "{{stock}}"

#: A figure absent from the context whose digits, with every separator stripped, do match one
#: that is present: `1.500` against `1500`. A violation too, and the cause that would say a
#: separator rule needs a measurement rather than an opinion.
CAUSE_DECIMAL_FORM = "decimal_form"
#: A price or stock placeholder written in a **free query**, where no piece is anchored. Checked
#: only when `product_id is None`: with an anchor the placeholder is not merely allowed, it is
#: what the prompt asks for, and the .NET side substitutes the real figure.
#:
#: Without an anchor there is nothing to substitute it against. `PitchPlaceholderResolver`
#: withholds the **whole** argument the moment it meets one, by design and with a test fixing
#: it, so a placeholder here does not degrade the prose — it deletes it. The prompt asks the
#: model not to write them; this is the guardrail that makes the asking a guarantee, and it is
#: what makes the frequency **measurable partitioned by cause** instead of showing up as an
#: unexplained drop in delivered arguments.
CAUSE_PLACEHOLDER_IN_FREE_QUERY = "placeholder_in_free_query"

# --- C32a · the sale assistant's tool registry ----------------------------------------------

#: first was served by a change that was cancelled, the second was cut when its signals
#: measured empty over the real catalogue. Naming them nowhere would make their return a

#: The availability vocabulary, **qualitative and with no digit in it**. The projection stores

#: emitting a bucket verbatim would put a stock figure into the model's context — the thing the
#: service boundary forbids and the thing `SearchHit.qty_bucket` already declares when it says
#: that «a bucket on the wire would be the beginning of one».
#:

#: piece — and it is NOT an absence of stock. The precedent is literal and it is the port's:
#: `qty_bucket = None` means «ran unscoped, which is not the same as a bucket of zero».
#:

#: without a cycle. The coupling is not lost, it is moved to where it can fail loudly:
#: `test_every_bucket_the_feed_can_store_has_a_label` compares these keys against `QTY_BUCKETS`
#: itself, so a tenth bucket added to the feed breaks a test rather than silently falling

#: Why a tool observation came back failed. **Codes, never prose**, the same rule the

#: They are in Spanish because their siblings in this file are: the tool names, their
#: descriptions and the availability labels all are, and a consumer reading `sin_ambito` beside
#: `unknown_reference` would be reading two vocabularies that were never meant to be two.
#:
#: An exception is **not** one of the options. One escaping would kill the consuming loop
#: instead of costing it one turn, and a generic `error` would leave the model blind exactly

TOOL_CAUSE_DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE = "dependencia_no_disponible"

#: **The fifth, added by C32b, and the only one a tool never emits.** The consumer refused the
#: call because the request's tool budget was spent, so nothing was executed and **no port was
#: touched**. It lives in this vocabulary rather than in one of the loop's own because it
#: reaches the model in exactly the same place the other four do — as the cause of a failed
#: observation — and a consumer that had to read two vocabularies to branch on one field would
#: be reading the seam rather than the answer.
#:

#: `ProjectionFreshness.synced_at()`, which are reads of a checkpoint, and the invariant would
#: be unsatisfiable with the very ports this registry is required to inject. Token equality
#: catches every spelling built from one of these verbs — `save_profile`, `bulk_insert`,

#: nothing under substring reading either, so the comparison rule is not what loses it. The
#: same goes for the family it belongs to: `put_`, `store_`, `record_`, `commit`, `flush`. The
#: vocabulary is fixed by the change's design decision and widening it is a decision, not a

#: substitute from a catalogue match — so the text that reads it moves to a new version instead
#: of being edited in place: the 120 generations C30b measured against v3, and the 89 of C31,
#: have to stay interpretable. Same precedent, same reason, third time.
#:
#: `PROMPT_VERSION` above is **unchanged and still what `POST /v1/assist/sale` reports**. The two
#: travel as separate values on the agent's response.
AGENT_PITCH_PROMPT_VERSION = "assist/v4"

#: The model that runs the loop. A **setting with its own variable**, and it never inherits the
#: argument's nor the classifier's: choosing *which tool* is a harder call than choosing *which
#: label*, and sharing a variable would make any comparison of cost between the three false —
#: the argument C30b made against C09's and C31 made against C30b's, applied a third time.
#:
#: **Opened at `gpt-4o` and declared as a choice to be measured, not as a preference.** C31
#: measured `gpt-4o-mini` silencing three answerable queries of 119 where `gpt-4o` silenced none
#: with no prompt change at all, and tool selection is the harder task. The cheap arm is run in
#: the same pass over the same two sets, because the fourfold of model in the cost arithmetic is
#: a variable and not a law: if it holds the selection it is one environment variable away.
DEFAULT_AGENT_MODEL = "openai/gpt-4o"

#: Seconds **one** provider call of the loop may take. Per call and never per request: a request
#: makes up to five of them and measuring the total against a one-call limit is how a small cut
#: reads as a large one, the mistake `PITCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` already names.
#:
#: **Declared NOT calibrated**, in the position `ROUTER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` occupies and for the
#: same reason: there is no latency distribution of a tool-calling turn behind it. It is an
#: upper bound taken from the wall-clock budget divided by the iteration ceiling, not a budget.
AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 8.0

#: Turns of the loop one request may take. The guard of the loop, with an explicit exhaustion
#: branch rather than a silent fall-through: a loop that ends by running out of range and a loop
#: that ends because the model finished are two different answers to the consumer.
MAX_AGENT_ITERATIONS = 5

#: Tool executions one request may pay for, accumulated **across** turns and not per turn. A
#: per-turn cap would let five turns of four calls through, which is twenty.
#:
#: **Opened at six by the change's ficha and moved to eight by the pass**, run
#: `293fe5c6e470` over 102 requests on `gpt-4o`: p50 **2**, p95 **5**, and **4 of 102 (3,9 %)**
#: at the ceiling. Eight is p95 plus three.
#:
#: **What the measurement does NOT say, and it matters:** of the four requests the ceiling
#: truncated, nobody knows how many calls they would have used — the ceiling cut them. So
#: eight is a judgement informed by the distribution, not a measurement of the untruncated
#: need, and it is written here as such.
#:
#: The number also has to fit the one sequence this capability exists for. A full pivot is a
#: search, the availability of the piece to be offered, the substitutes call and the
#: availability of at most two of them: **five**, which left one spare under six and leaves
#: three under eight. That budget was being spent before `agent/v1` told the loop to check the
#: availability of the piece it will offer rather than of every candidate — with five
#: candidates that pattern cost exactly six calls and the pivot never happened.
MAX_AGENT_TOOL_CALLS = 8

#: Tool calls of a single turn that may run at once. **Four, and the number comes from the tree
#: rather than from taste**: the connection pool is five with no overflow and each search opens
#: its own session, so six concurrent tools queue against themselves and the last waits out
#: `pool_timeout` — which reads like an unavailable database rather than like self-inflicted
#: contention.
MAX_AGENT_CONCURRENT_TOOL_CALLS = 4

#: **The ceiling of one agent request, and it is derived from the constants of its three stages
#: rather than written as a digit**: one classification, at most one decision per loop turn, and
#: the argument with its single repair. A change to any of the three cannot leave a stale
#: literal behind, and an assertion at the close reads the accumulated figure against it — the
#: property C31 delivered for three, one layer up.
MAX_AGENT_PROVIDER_CALLS = (
    MAX_ROUTER_PROVIDER_CALLS + MAX_AGENT_ITERATIONS + MAX_PITCH_PROVIDER_CALLS
)

#: Accumulated **prompt** tokens after which the loop stops. Enforced **after** a turn and not
#: before one, and that is a dependency decision rather than a preference: enforcing it
#: beforehand needs a tokeniser, which `openspec/project.md` does not document as a dependency
#: of this service. The pair «characters before, tokens after» gives a deterministic bound that
#: can be evaluated in advance plus a cut that can overshoot by **at most one turn** — and that
#: turn is itself bounded by the other five budgets.
#:
#: **What it compares is the classifier plus the loop**, because that is what has accumulated
#: when the check runs: the argument is generated after the loop and never reaches it. The first
#: calibration of this budget read the request's whole `prompt_tokens`, argument included, which
#: is a different quantity (p95 18.781) — found by the independent verification of C32b.
#:
#: **Fixed by measurement, over the quantity it governs.** Run `293fe5c6e470`, 102 requests on
#: `gpt-4o`: classifier plus loop prompt tokens **p50 10.622 · p95 16.244 · max 18.260**; on the
#: cheap arm p95 16.298 and max 22.019 (`--rescore`, with the classifier's share derived from
#: the artefact's own requests that ran no argument). The placeholder this replaces was
#: 120.000, loose on purpose so the pass could see a request whole, and useless as a budget.
#:
#: Forty thousand is ~2,5 x that p95 and ~1,8 x the largest request either arm produced, with
#: room for the tool ceiling having moved from six to eight. A budget is there to stop a loop
#: that runs away, not to trim the tail of ordinary traffic: nothing observed comes near it,
#: and a request that did would be reporting something this pass never saw.
AGENT_TOKEN_BUDGET = 40_000

#: Characters of accumulated observations, evaluated **before** a turn is sent. The section that
#: grows: every observation is re-sent on every later turn, so this is the budget that actually
#: governs the cost of a loop, and it is the deterministic half of the pair above.
#:
#: **Fixed by the same run: p50 1.847 · p95 4.709 · max 17.053.** The placeholder was 40.000,
#: 8,5 times the p95. Thirty thousand is ~1,8 x the largest observed accumulation and leaves
#: margin for the tool ceiling having moved from six to eight, which is the change that makes
#: this section grow.
AGENT_OBSERVATION_BUDGET_CHARS = 30_000

#: Characters of the whole context — the transcript section plus the observation section — so
#: that a long conversation cannot eat the budget of the evidence, which is where the answer is.
#: **Per section and also global**, which is why there are three numbers here and not one.
#:
#: The observation budget plus the transcript's own maximum plus a margin. **With these default
#: values the global bound cannot bind**: observations stop at 30.000 and a transcript cannot
#: exceed `MAX_TRANSCRIPT_CHARS`, so the sum never reaches 36.000. That is deliberate and it is
#: not decoration: lowering the global below the sum would let a long transcript eat the
#: evidence's budget, which is what Q-4 forbade. It binds when a sweep raises the observation
#: budget through `AgentBudgets`, which is the one configuration in which nothing else would
#: bound the context, and a test drives that branch rather than leaving it unexecuted.
AGENT_CONTEXT_BUDGET_CHARS = 36_000

#: Seconds the **whole request** may take, argument included — **plus, at most, the tool calls
#: of the turn in flight**, which are not cancelled mid-query because cancelling a session in a
#: pool of five with no overflow invalidates the connection. A deadline and not a per-call
#: timeout: without one, the worst case is five turns at the provider's own timeout plus the
#: tools plus the generation, which goes well past the latency this route declares.
#:
#: **How it is held.** The loop runs against the deadline **minus the argument's reserve**
#: (`AGENT_PITCH_RESERVE_SECONDS`), and the provider call of every turn is bounded by whatever is
#: left of that, so a turn in flight is cut by the clock rather than allowed to spend its own
#: timeout past it. The argument then has its reserve. Until the independent verification of
#: C32b the clock was only checked **before** a turn, so a turn started at 14,9 s ran its full
#: timeout and the argument ran after it: a request with a 0,2 s deadline took 0,479 s, and the
#: worst case by construction was 15 + 8 + 2 x 4 = 31 s plus the tools.
#:
#: **Fixed by measurement.** Run `293fe5c6e470`, 102 requests on `gpt-4o`: **p50 5,3 s · p95
#: 9,0 s · max 11,9 s** end to end; on the cheap arm p95 10,3 s and max 14,3 s. The split is what
#: makes the reserve free: on `gpt-4o` the loop alone takes **p95 4,7 s · max 5,8 s** and the
#: classifier plus the argument **p95 5,2 s · max 8,0 s**. With seven seconds for the loop, **0
#: of 102** `gpt-4o` requests and 3 of 102 on the cheap arm would have been cut.
#:
#: Exceeding it is a degradation and not a failure: the evidence gathered so far is served and
#: the response says the clock stopped it.
AGENT_DEADLINE_SECONDS = 15.0

#: Seconds of the deadline **reserved for the argument**: its two provider calls at their own
#: timeout. **Derived from the constants of that stage and never written as a digit**, like the
#: provider-call ceiling — a change to either cannot leave a stale reserve behind. The route
#: recomputes it from the configured timeout, because that is the value its client actually uses.
AGENT_PITCH_RESERVE_SECONDS = MAX_PITCH_PROVIDER_CALLS * PITCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS

#: Distinct pieces that may reach the generation payload, however many turns saw them. The rule
#: is C30b's and it is about the numeric gate, not about tidiness: **every field handed over
#: widens the whitelist of admissible numerals**, and the gate measured zero violations over a
#: payload carrying one SKU. A loop that searched five times could otherwise hand over fifty.
MAX_AGENT_PIECES = 8

#: Where a group of the evidence payload came from. **A closed vocabulary of two**, because a
#: substitute and a match are different things to say to a customer and a payload that flattened
#: them would let the argument offer a second best as though it were what was asked for.
GROUP_ORIGIN_CATALOGUE = "catalogo"
GROUP_ORIGIN_SUBSTITUTES = "sustitutos"

GROUP_ORIGINS: tuple[str, ...] = (GROUP_ORIGIN_CATALOGUE, GROUP_ORIGIN_SUBSTITUTES)

#: Why the loop stopped. **A closed vocabulary, and never deduced by the consumer from the
#: counters**: «five iterations» does not say whether the fifth was the last one needed or the
#: one that ran out, and those are opposite statements about the answer being read.

STOP_CLARIFICATION = "aclaracion"

#: The reason a request that never entered the loop reports. **Not one of the budget values and
#: not `sin_mas_herramientas` either**: the guardrail refused before any turn, so saying the
#: model stopped asking for tools would describe a loop that never ran.
STOP_REFUSED = "rechazado"

#: And the one a deployment with no agent credential reports, which is the fail-open, the
#: ablation and the rollback in one. Distinct from a refusal for the same reason the two refusal
#: codes are distinct from each other: they are different sentences for whoever reads them.
STOP_NO_CLIENT = "sin_cliente"

#: **The turn died in the provider**, and this value exists because a measurement found its
#: absence. C32b's first provider pass hit a rate limit on request six and every one after it
#: came back reporting `sin_mas_herramientas` with `partial: false` — that is, «the model
#: finished asking for tools» about a request whose call never arrived, indistinguishable from a
#: complete response. How many is not known: the run left no artefact, and the two counts written
#: down from its console (46 and 64) disagree.
#:
#: A fault costs the turn and not the request: whatever earlier turns gathered is still served.
#: But an answer built on a loop that was cut short is not the answer an unhurried request would
#: have produced, so it is **partial**, and the reason says which of the endings it was.

#: Turns a transcript may carry, and the two length caps that go with it. **Part of the contract
#: and not an implementation detail**: carrying the conversation in the request is what lets this
#: service store nothing between calls, and the price of that is that the client now controls the
#: factor that dominates the cost of a loop. `MAX_TURN_CHARS` is the cap the single-query field
