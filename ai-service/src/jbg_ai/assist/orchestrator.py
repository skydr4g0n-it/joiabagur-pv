"""One sale-assistance request, in whichever of the three modes it is. C30a, C30b, C31.

**All three modes can now write, and one of them is classified before it retrieves anything.**
The two anchored modes hand what this module has already assembled to the generation layer. The
free query is put to a classifier *first* — one call, before `retrieve_products` — and what
comes back decides whether the request is served at all, which index answers it, and which task
section writes it. An abstained request still calls no provider: writing confidently about an
empty candidate set is the failure the abstention rule exists to prevent, and that rule remains
in place as the net it has always been, **behind** the new gate rather than instead of it.

    M1  consulta sola      → CLASIFICAR, y entonces: rechazar · repreguntar · recuperar y redactar
    M2  pieza sola         → sin clasificador: no hay consulta que clasificar
    M3  pieza con pregunta → sin clasificador: `both` por construcción, y su guardarraíl es
                             el umbral de conocimiento que ya corre — cero citas, coste cero

Both clients are **injected and never built here**, like every other port this module takes.

* With no `pitch_client` the response is exactly C30a's — empty argument, absent prompt
  version — which is what makes the generation layer measurable as an ablation.
* With no `router_client` the free query is served exactly as C30b served it: the intent
  reports unclassified, both indexes are consulted, the abstention rule applies, and nothing
  is generated. That is the **fail-open**, and it is also the ablation and the rollback. It is
  a branch in `_task_of` and in the route check above it, never a swallowed exception.
