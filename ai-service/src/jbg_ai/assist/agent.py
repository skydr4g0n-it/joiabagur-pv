**The loop gathers evidence and writes nothing.** If its last turn wrote the prose it would
step around, in one move, the numeric gate that refuses a figure absent from the context, the
referential integrity of citations and the single repair — the three properties the generation
layer exists to hold. It also keeps «nothing is persisted» for free, because the intermediate
reasoning never leaves the process: the port it is handed has nowhere to put any.

**The classifier is a guardrail here and not a router.** One classification per request, over
the turn being answered. A refusal short-circuits on any turn; the insufficiency verdict is
**ignored**, because a follow-up turn is elliptical and «¿y en dorado?» judged alone reports
missing information the conversation already supplied; and the index verdict is **discarded**,
because choosing where to look is the decision this loop exists to make.

**Six budgets, and the two that matter most are not step counts.** What dominates the cost of
a loop is the accumulated context, because every observation is re-sent on every later turn —
so characters are checked before a call and tokens after one, and the wall clock is checked
against a deadline for the whole request because it is the only budget a counter feels.
