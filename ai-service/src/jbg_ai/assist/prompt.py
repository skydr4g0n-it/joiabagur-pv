"""The versioned prompt, and the payload object the numeric gate reads. Delivered by C30b.

Two things live here and they are deliberately the same module, because they are the same
decision seen from two sides: **what the model is handed** and **which figures are therefore
admissible in what it writes**. The gate reads `PitchPayload.numerals()`; the user message
renders `PitchPayload.as_data()`. One object, so the admitted set cannot drift from the data.

**The gate reads the object and never the rendered prompt.** If it read the text, the numerals
of the instructions themselves would join the whitelist and the gate would open on its own —
`prompts/assist/v1.md` is written without a single digit so that this rule costs nothing, but
the rule does not depend on that discipline holding.

**The payload carries only what the model needs in order to write**, and that is a property of
the gate and not tidiness: every numeral handed over widens the whitelist, so `product_id` — a
UUID whose digits are arbitrary, and which a counter argument never mentions — is left out on
purpose, and so are the retrieval scores.
