"""The routing evaluation: the manifest, the confusion matrix, and the veto. C31.

**Five of the six classes are referenced and not copied**, which is the manifest's own decision
and the reason this module resolves them rather than reading a list: the day somebody adds a
query to the golden set or an `eval_question` to a document, a copied fixture would fall behind
in silence. It is the same argument C23 used to put the evaluation question *inside* each
corpus document.

**Loading validates, and a violation is a refusal rather than a warning**, exactly as
`evals/golden.py` does it. A manifest that declares 48 `catalog` cases against a golden set
holding 47 is a manifest describing a measurement nobody can reproduce, and the cheapest moment
to find that out is before the provider is called 119 times.

    catalog           48   golden, ocho categorías juzgadas          C24 / C26
    not_in_catalogue  20   golden, categoría `fuera-de-dominio`      C24
    out_of_domain      5   data/knowledge/_eval/out-of-domain.yaml   C23
    knowledge         32   marca `eval_question`, una por documento  C23
    ambiguous          4   golden, categoría `ambigua`, sin juicios  C24
    both              10   escritos en el manifiesto                 C31

                     119

**The veto is computed here and is not a judgement call.** A single `descripcion-sin-anclaje`
query silenced rejects the configuration however many of the twenty impossible ones it catches.
The asymmetry is the one already measured and argued in `retrieval/abstention.py`: silencing a
query the shop *can* answer is a visible failure at the counter, while failing to refuse an
impossible one shows candidates that do not fit and the operator sees that.

**The two rates are reported apart and never summed.** The router's refusal rate comes from
here; the retriever's abstention rate comes from C25 and is not recomputed, because recomputing
it would need the live index and would produce a *third* number that looks like the published
one and is not. It travels as a declared figure with its provenance beside it.
