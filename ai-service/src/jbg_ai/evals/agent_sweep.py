"""The two-armed provider pass of the agent loop. C32b.

**A dated measurement, not a reproducible row.** It calls a language model, so it lives beside
`assist_sweep.py` and `cag_run.py` and not inside the runner that re-executes on every
evaluation — keeping the two apart is what stops an irreproducible figure from entering a table
of reproducible ones.

What it measures, and the reading that matters is always the **distribution**:

    carga          p50/p95 de tokens, de contexto y de reloj · curva de crecimiento por vuelta
                   coste por brazo de modelo · sobrecoste contra el pipeline determinista
    calibración    herramienta muerta · causa de argumento recurrente · NOMBRE INVENTADO
                   llamadas casi idénticas · tasa de pivote POR ETIQUETA de disponibilidad

An agent has a long tail — the request that loops to its limit is the one that ruins a mean —
so no aggregate is published here without its percentiles.

**It drives the real layer.** `run_agent` is the function the route calls; a harness that
re-implemented the loop would measure the re-implementation, which is the mistake this
repository already names in `evals/configs.py`. What it changes is the model of the arm and
nothing else: the budgets, the prompts and the registry are the serving ones.

**This is the declared exception to the no-persistence rule.** The serving path writes no
transcript, no argument and no tool argument anywhere, log included. The harness writes the
**rich** trace — arguments and observations — bound to a run identifier, a commit and the
prompt versions, because the granularity question cannot be answered without it: «two nearly
identical calls to one tool» is a statement about arguments. The transcripts are synthetic and
no operator wrote them, which is what makes that exception cheap here.

    uv run python -m jbg_ai.evals.agent_sweep --dry-run          # procedencia y tamaño
    uv run python -m jbg_ai.evals.agent_sweep --limit 3 --arms openai/gpt-4o   # humo
    uv run python -m jbg_ai.evals.agent_sweep                    # la pasada entera
    uv run python -m jbg_ai.evals.agent_sweep --rescore evals/results/<artefacto>.json

**`--rescore` recomputes every aggregate from an artefact already written**, with no provider
and no database: cost priced stage by stage, pivot rates per arm, the calibration scored against
the expectations it ran with and against the current ones. It exists because the independent
verification of C32b found three figures of the published report that no committed code could
reproduce — the corrected cost, the pooled pivot table and the OK/MISS count — and a number
nobody can recompute is a number nobody can check.
