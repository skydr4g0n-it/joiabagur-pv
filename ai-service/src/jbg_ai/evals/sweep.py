"""The calibration sweep, in two phases, and the rule that may move a default. C24, recast by C25.

**The rule was written before the measurement ran**, which is the only thing that makes "the
sweep was redone with the good judge" a claim rather than an impression. C25 reformulates it,
and the reformulation is itself dated and argued in `design.md` D14 **before** any sweep ran:

    a default changes if and only if
      · the improvement on the NEW queries exceeds 0.05, AND
      · no measured category degrades by more than 0.05.

    the tuning subset is reported as a DIAGNOSTIC of contamination and never vetoes.

Why the tuning subset stopped being a veto is a property of that subset, visible without
looking at any result: **6 of its 8 queries sit at the ceiling of nDCG@5** and all 8 at the
ceiling of Recall@5, P@3 and MRR — a saturated reading cannot improve, only tie or fall — and
**7 of the 8 come from the curated list C20/C21 calibrated the lexical branch with**. Requiring
its agreement vetoes raising the vector weight using the very queries chosen to make the
lexical branch win. C24 published the evidence itself: 0.942 on tuning against 0.535 on new,
which it called "the contamination of the tuning set, quantified". A contaminated partition is
evidence of the incumbent's overfitting, not a control group.

**The grid is one-dimensional**, because only the RATIO of the branch weights changes the
order — scaling both preserves it, which was measured by running `fuse` — so the sweep is over
`rho = w_vec / w_lex` and the pair is renormalised to sum to one. The useful band is narrow,
`rho in [0.9, 1.1]`, and the previous grid had exactly one point inside it: that is why its
optimum looked like a knife edge.

`k` and the branch depth move TOGETHER or neither means anything, by C21's rule that a deeper
branch keeps more of its tail voting.

**And the sweep has two phases, because the business signals do not change WHICH candidates
are retrieved, only their order.** `demote` is a stable sort that removes nothing, so a window
captured once can be re-scored over hundreds of weight combinations in seconds, with no
provider and no database. That makes reproducibility a STRUCTURAL property rather than a
promise about seeds. The order of the phases is a constraint and not a preference: the fusion
moves the window, so it is frozen first — and each captured window records the fusion it was
taken under, so a re-score against a different one is refused instead of silently wrong.
