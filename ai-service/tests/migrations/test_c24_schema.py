"""C24 schema: the three evaluation tables the foundation revision never created.

`GET /v1/evals/runs` has been published in the frozen contract since C02 and its stub named
C24 in writing as the change that would fill it. These tests pin what that route now reads
from, the invariants the database enforces on its own, and the reversibility that makes the
revision safe to open in a change whose ticket declares no migration.
