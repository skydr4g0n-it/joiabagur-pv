"""Driving the generation layer offline. Delivered by C30b.

**The fake goes in at the provider's door and not above it.** `scripted_client` builds the
real `LiteLlmAssistClient` with a scripted `complete`, so every test still exercises the real
parsing, the real timeout, the real usage extraction and the real accumulation — only the
socket is replaced. A stand-in for the whole client would have tested the test.

Lives in `support/` rather than in a `conftest.py` for the reason `support/settings.py` already
records: `conftest.py` is pytest's fixture mechanism and not an importable module, so anything
a test module needs at import time has to live here.
