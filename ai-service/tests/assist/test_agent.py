"""The agent loop, its port, its guardrail and its six budgets. C32b.

Offline like the rest of this suite: no chat provider, no embedding provider, no network and no
database. Every port and every one of the three clients goes in through the constructor seam
the layer has required since C30a, and the scripted provider decides what the model asks for on
each turn — which is what lets a loop whose real behaviour is non-deterministic be tested
**deterministically**, one stop condition and one budget at a time.

The acceptance scenarios of HU-AIENG-032b are traced from here; each test that carries one
names it in its docstring so the mapping survives a rename.
