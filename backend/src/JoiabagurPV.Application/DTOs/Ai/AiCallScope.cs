/// There are exactly two construction paths and no third. <see cref="ForPointOfSale"/> requires
/// a concrete point of sale: from C22 onward the <c>pos_id</c> claim becomes the retriever's only
/// hard filter, so a sentinel value such as "*" or "system" reaching it would be a cross-POS leak
/// wearing a convenience-parameter costume. <see cref="ForCatalog"/> carries none at all, for the
/// routes that operate over the whole catalog — enrichment, and later index synchronization — and
/// therefore belong to no point of sale.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The second path is not a relaxation of the first: it is a different scope, and it is
/// <em>refused</em> by every point-of-sale operation of the client. Making the leaking state
/// unconstructible is cheaper than asking people not to write it; refusing the catalog scope
/// where a point of sale is mandatory is what keeps that guarantee once the state exists.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A sealed class rather than a record struct on purpose: every struct has an implicit
/// <c>default</c> value, which would be a scope with neither kind nor identity and would defeat
/// the guarantee above. A private constructor on a class has no such hole.
