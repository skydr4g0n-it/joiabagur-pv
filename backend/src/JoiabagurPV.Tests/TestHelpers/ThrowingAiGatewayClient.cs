/// <summary>
/// Base for hand-written doubles of <see cref="IAiGatewayClient"/>: every operation throws
/// <see cref="NotSupportedException"/> until a derived double overrides the ones it uses.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The interface grows by rule — each contracted endpoint is added by the change that first calls
/// it — and before this class every hand-written double had to be edited each time it did, seven
/// of them when C34 added two operations. Deriving from here, a double names only what its test
/// exercises, and the next operation breaks nothing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Throwing rather than returning an empty response on purpose: a double answered on a path the
/// test did not expect should fail loudly, not hand back a plausible nothing.
