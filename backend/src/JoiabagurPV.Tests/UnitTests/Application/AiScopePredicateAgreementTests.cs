/// <para>
/// This class exists because the guard C40_FIX shipped for its own central invariant —
/// <c>AssistedSearchServiceTests.GetAvailability_WithoutPointOfSale_MatchesTheRoutePredicate</c> —
/// computes its expected value with the same extension methods the probe uses and never invokes
/// <see cref="FreeQuerySearchService"/> at all. Measured: it stays green both when the shared
/// predicate's null branch is inverted and when the route is rewritten to apply a different rule
/// for the absence. A test that survives the divergence it is named after is not a guard.
/// </para>

/// So the comparison here is made the only way it can bite: build the probe and the route over the
/// <em>same</em> options objects, ask one and <em>run</em> the other, and compare the verdicts
