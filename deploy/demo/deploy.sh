# deploy.sh — deploys the isolated demo environment (C17)
#
# Runs ON THE HOST, invoked through the systems management service by
# `.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml`, or by the host's own provisioning on
# first boot. It is idempotent: running it twice recreates the containers and
# leaves the data alone.
#
# WHY THERE IS NO `set -x` ANYWHERE NEAR THE SECRETS
# --------------------------------------------------
# The standard output and standard error of a command sent through the systems
# management service are ARCHIVED in the command history, readable by anyone
# who can read that history, and retained long after the deployment. Execution
# tracing would print every expansion — including the value of every parameter
# read below — straight into that archive. If you need to debug this script,
# add echo statements naming the variables, never their values, and never turn
# on tracing above the point where the last secret is used.
#
# WHY NO ENVIRONMENT FILE IS WRITTEN
# ----------------------------------
# Secrets are read into the environment of THIS process and interpolated by
# Compose from there. Nothing lands on the host's disk. Be honest about the
# limit of that: a container's environment is readable with `docker inspect` by
# anyone who is root on this host. It is proportionate for a demonstration
# environment, and it is not a vault.

# the person opening the demo is not the one who pays for it.

# deployment. Whether the environment is actually correct is decided by the
# post-deployment verification, which is not best-effort.
